Knights of Papers

Duel of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using Unity's MLAgents simulator

Algorithms so far: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Imagination-Augmented Agents (I2A), and Decision Transformers
(models and training found in build3 folder)

Each algorithm is trained by self-play
